# Robotic-arm-implementation-first-week-task
the final shape after implementing the robot arm

Implementation instruction 
1- insert the base and start combining on it
2- insert the waist and place it on the base and make thier centers coincidence
3- bring arm 1 and join the end with the wiast
4- bring arm 2 and join it with the other end of arm 1
5- insert the gripper at the other end of arm 2 
6- finally make sure to fix any joint in each step

brief: the program used to assembly the robot arm is Cinema 4d and the file is STL. the program cost me several hours to learn how to use it since this is my first time, and less than one hour to implemnting after gaining some experience in Cinema 4d.
